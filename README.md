# node-js-api-examples
These examples cover a range of scenarios commonly encountered when working with APIs in Node.js.

# Simple API Call (GET Request)

Problem: Write a program that makes a GET request to a public API (e.g., GitHub API) and prints the response data.

# Paginated API Results

Problem: Make a GET request to an API that returns paginated results. Write code to fetch and process all pages of data.

# POST Request to an API

Problem: Write a program that sends a POST request to an API with a JSON payload and handles the response.

# Fetch and Parse JSON Response

Problem: Write a program that fetches data from an API that returns a JSON object, and extracts specific information from the response.

# Error Handling in REST API Calls

Problem: Write a program that makes an API call and handles different error statuses (e.g., 404, 500) gracefully.

# Process API Data and Perform Aggregation

Problem: Write a program that makes an API call, processes the JSON response, and aggregates data (e.g., find the average of a particular field across all results).

# Authentication in REST API Calls

Problem: Implement a program that makes an authenticated API call using an API key or OAuth token.

# Rate Limiting Handling

Problem: Write a program that makes API requests but handles rate limits by pausing execution when the limit is reached.
